I am a Ph.D. student in Experimental Particle Physics at Duke University. My research involves writing code and analyzing data from sub-atomic particle collisions at very high energies. I am also very interested in machine learning. In my spare time, I like reading about ML algorithms and also applying them, even beyond my physics research, in some of my pet projects.


I currently work in the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern) of the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider). For my thesis project, I analyze data to search for a production process of the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson), known as the vector boson fusion (VBF) process, from the proton-proton collisions. I am also part of the analysis team looking for [BSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model) motivated new particle decaying into top quarks. In the past, I have also worked on the design of the proposed [Future Circular Hadron Collider (FCC-hh)](http://tlep.web.cern.ch/content/fcc-hh). I am also one of the analyzers in the team, measuring the most precise mass of the [W boson](https://home.cern/science/physics/w-boson-sunshine-and-stardust)  from the [Collider Detector at Fermilab](https://www-cdf.fnal.gov) proton-antiproton collision data.
